This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates a common coding error: the ZeroDivisionError exception.  The script calculates the average of a list of numbers.  The initial version fails when the list is empty or contains non-numeric values.  A corrected version is provided that gracefully handles these cases, improving the robustness of the code.  This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling in software development.
